* specs for initial code
  - did it kinda ass-backwards with the first feature, as the feature should
    drive out specs for classes and in turn, the implementation, not the other
    way around
* Config for the app needs work: what does the rest of the world do?
  - i have a feeling I'm reinventing the wheel for detecting whether
    the app is run all-in-one-dir vs. installed in /usr or /usr/local
* Need a CLI
