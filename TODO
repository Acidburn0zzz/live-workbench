* refactor duplicate code in spec & feature step definitions
  - the feature is supposed to exercise the whole stack, from view through
    controller to model.  the duplicate code indicates a bigger problem, that
    the feature therefore tests too low a leve with the model & view tightly
    coupled to controller in core.rb
  - follow MVC
    - model = project.rb (an abstraction of filesystem)
    - controller = core.rb -> rename to controller.rb?
    - view = cli.rb
* config.rb
  - generate config via setup.rb hook
  - see example code from Mozillion
    - http://svn.luon.net/filedetails.php?repname=goat&path=/trunk/lib/pre-setup.rb
    - http://svn.luon.net/filedetails.php?repname=goat&path=/trunk/lib/post-clean.rb
